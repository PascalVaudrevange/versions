Description: \code{versions} installs specified versions of R packages
 hosted on CRAN and provides functions to list available versions and the
 versions of currently installed packages. These tools can be used to help
 make R projects and packages more reproducible.
 \code{versions} fits in the narrow gap between the devtools
 \code{install_version} function and the \code{checkpoint} package.
 \code{devtools::install_version} installs a stated package version from
 source files stored on the CRAN archives. However CRAN does not store
 binary versions of packages so Windows users need to have RTools installed
 and Windows and OSX users get longer installation times.
 \code{checkpoint} uses the Revolution Analytics MRAN server to
 install packages (from source or binary) as they were available on
 a given date. It also provides a helpful interface to detect the packages
 in use in a directory and install all of those packages for a given date.
 \code{checkpoint} doesn't provide \code{install.packages}-like functionality
 however, and that's what \code{versions} aims to do, by querying MRAN.
 As MRAN only goes back to 2014-09-17, \code{versions} can't install package
 from before this date.
